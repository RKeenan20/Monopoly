# sw_engineering_monopoly
## Software Engineering Final Project Description
## Team members: Robert Keenan & Ciaran Nolan

- The aim of this assignment is to create a fully functional version of the board game Monopoly using Java
- This repository will contain all the functional code required to run this game
- The objective of this variant of Monopoly is to own as much land as possible and be the richest person in the game


### Board Structure

- We will aim to implement each of the squares in terms of name, value, rent, mortgage by using the .properties files inside of the ie.ucd.gameConfigurations. This means that anyone can use our source code and put in their own custom version of Monopoly like the US, Irish and UK versions. 
- We will split this into Utilities, Properties/Streets and then there is Chance/Community Squares
